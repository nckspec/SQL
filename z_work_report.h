/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: still needs the ability to return only certain fields
        still have not implemented 'insert into'



        -Implemented: The select command has been implemented. You can filter
        for values using the 'where' command. You can retreive the whole
        table using '*'. The loop has been created that asks for commands.
        The destructor destroys temporary files created when filtering for
        conditions.




    Bugs     :   None that I know of at the moment.




    Reflections: The project is coming along nicely. Even though only the select
    command has been completed, I have laid the framework for completing everything
    else .
